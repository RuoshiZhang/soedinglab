Johannes Söding obtained his PhD in 1996 in laser cooling of neutral atoms at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics and did postdoctoral experimental work on Bose-Einstein condensation of neutral atoms at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. After three years as consultant at the Boston Consulting Group, he returned to science in 2002. He started his career in bioinformatics with Andrei Lupas at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, working on protein evolution, remote homology detection and structure prediction. In 2007 he became an independent research group leader at the Gene Center of the University of Munich (LMU). Since 2014 he leads the research group Quantitative and Computational Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. His group develops statistical and computational methods for analyzing data from high-throughput biological experiments, in particular for protein function and structure prediction, sequence search and assembly in metagenomics, transcription regulation, gene regulatory networks, and systems medicine. He is married and has three children (2002, 2004, 2008).
